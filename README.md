Web-IRC
A feature-rich Websocket IRC client in JavaScript

There's absolutely no setup required. Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Connect to any IRC server that allows websockets (Both ws:// and wss://) and the underlying websocket protocol 'text.ircv3.net'

NOTE: Chromium based and FireFox do NOT allow ws:// sockets to be opened over a https:// connection! If you want to offer the ability to connect to both ws:// and wss:// this page must be hosted via http://, not https://. Unfortunately http connections can open both insecure and secure websockets, where https forces only secure sockets.

"all your base are belong to us!"
