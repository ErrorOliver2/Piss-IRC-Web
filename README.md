Web-IRC
A feature-rich Websocket IRC client in JavaScript

There's absolutely no setup required. Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Connect to any IRC server that allows websockets (Both ws:// and wss://) and the underlying websocket protocol 'text.ircv3.net'

If you wish to link this say on your site to your irc server, you can feed this a query-string with the key of perform, which will start the client with the specified command pre-loaded into the status window editbox.

Example: &lt;a href="/path/here/?perform=/server+wss://fiery.swiftirc.net:4443"&gt;Chat Now!&lt;/a&gt;

Try out this <a href="https://chat.swiftirc.net/?perform=/server+wss://fiery.swiftirc.net:4443">Demo</a>
